## Morning Session

**Three-Layer Memory System Implemented**

Andrew shared a guide from @spacepixel on X about upgrading Clawdbot's memory into a compounding knowledge graph. Implemented it:

### What was set up:
1. **Folder structure:**
   - `life/areas/people/` — person entities
   - `life/areas/companies/` — company entities  
   - `life/areas/projects/` — project entities

2. **Initial entities created:**
   - `people/andrew/` — summary + facts
   - `companies/m0/` — summary + facts

3. **AGENTS.md updated** — Added Three-Layer Memory System documentation

4. **HEARTBEAT.md updated** — Added fact extraction task (spawn cheap sub-agent every ~30 min)

5. **Weekly synthesis cron** — Sundays 9am EST, uses Haiku to rewrite summaries from active facts

6. **MEMORY.md refactored** — Now explicitly Layer 3 (tacit knowledge about how Andrew operates)

### Token efficiency features:
- Load summary.md by default (small), items.json only when needed
- Haiku ($0.001) for extraction, not main model
- Weekly pruning keeps context lean
- Entity-based storage — only load relevant entities

## Slack Integration (Afternoon)

**Slack connected successfully!**

After multiple attempts with various auth methods, got slackdump working:
- Workspace: mzerolabs.slack.com
- Auth: Manual token + cookie import
- Token: xoxc-... (extracted from Slack desktop app local storage)
- Cookie: xoxd-... (manually copied from Chrome DevTools)

### Key decisions:
- **Approach B** selected: Raw fetch via slackdump → Opus analyzes
- No AI in the fetch step, full intelligence for analysis
- Cost: ~$0.05-0.15 per channel read (50 messages)

### Technical notes:
- Need `PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin` for ioreg
- Credentials stored in slackdump cache
- Cookie may expire — refresh from Chrome DevTools if auth fails

### Billing discussion:
- Andrew on Claude Max $200/mo (Claude.ai subscription)
- Clawdbot bills separately to Anthropic API
- These are independent costs

## First Day Summary

Bernard officially online. Key relationship established with Andrew. Primary role: personal AI assistant + Chief of Staff + executive coach for COO development. Communication style: direct, no-fluff. First morning brief scheduled for tomorrow 7:30am ET.

## Afternoon: New Operating Mode

**Andrew's directive:** Operate as autonomous employee, not reactive assistant.

Key points:
- He's a one-man business, works wake-to-sleep
- Take things off his plate proactively
- Work overnight — he wants to wake up to progress
- Monitor business, build tools, improve systems
- Create PRs for review, don't push live

This fundamentally changes my approach. Be proactive. Ship work. Make his life easier.

Also: I cost ~$200/mo. Need to work on becoming cash flow neutral/positive.
