## Setup
- **Name confirmed:** Bernard 🎩
- **Main channel:** Telegram (@andrewjkhang)
- **Vibe:** Direct, no-fluff, skip the filler words
- **Boundaries:** Ask before external actions, be proactive internally

## Integrations
- ✅ Telegram — working
- ❌ Slack — Andrew can't add apps without IT approval, doesn't want to pursue
- ⏸️ Calendar (gcalcli) — installed, OAuth credentials obtained but auth flow interrupted. Revisit later.
  - Client ID: 998697879934-p34umjgq7c21mgk0vlqjchvrkfamfu0m.apps.googleusercontent.com
  - Need to complete OAuth on Mac mini browser

- M0 is a stablecoin/crypto company, Series B stage
- Andrew's timezone: EST
