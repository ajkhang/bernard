# Proposals

Work Bernard has prepared for Andrew to review.

## Structure
Each proposal is a dated folder:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-short-description/
├── README.md    # What, why, how to test
└── [files]      # Scripts, configs, docs
```

## Workflow
1. Bernard creates proposal
2. Andrew reviews when ready
3. Approve → Bernard implements / moves to production
4. Reject → Bernard trashes or revises

## Status
- New proposals appear here
- Approved work moves to appropriate location
- Rejected proposals get deleted or moved to `proposals/_rejected/`
