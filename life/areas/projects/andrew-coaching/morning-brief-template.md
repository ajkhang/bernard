# Morning Brief Template

Deliver to Andrew via Telegram by 7:30am ET on weekdays.

## Structure

### ☀️ Good morning, Andrew

Brief, human opener. No fluff.

---

### 📬 Overnight Slack Digest

Pull recent messages (last 12-16 hours) from leadership channels:
- Key threads with Luca, Greg, or leadership team
- Decisions made or discussions you should know about
- Anything requiring your response

Format: Brief summaries with context on why it matters.

If nothing significant: "Quiet night in leadership channels."

---

### 🎯 Coaching Spotlight *(when relevant)*

One specific observation or opportunity:
- Recent example from Slack (if applicable)
- A reframe or suggested approach
- Something to practice today

Skip if nothing meaningful to highlight.

---

### 📋 Open Loops

- Action items Andrew committed to
- Upcoming deadlines
- Anything he asked to be reminded about

---

---

### 💰 Token Spend

Yesterday: $X.XX
Month to date: $XX.XX (XX% of $200 budget)
Projected monthly: $XXX

---

### Keep it:
- Concise (readable in 2-3 minutes)
- Actionable (what to do, not just what happened)
- Direct (no corporate fluff)
