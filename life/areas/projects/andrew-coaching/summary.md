# Andrew COO Development Coaching

## Goal
Help Andrew develop from Deputy COO to COO by strengthening executive presence, strategic thinking, and leadership confidence.

## Promotion Timeline
Under evaluation for COO promotion later in 2026.

## Key Development Areas
1. **Reduce deference** — Stop deferring when he has a view; take positions
2. **Assert vs. present** — Own outcomes, don't just share information
3. **Strategic framing** — Frame contributions in terms of "what this means" not just "what happened"
4. **Challenge leadership** — Luca values people who push back; Andrew needs to do this more

## Coaching Method
- Daily Slack review of leadership conversations
- Track assert/defer ratio
- Note missed opportunities to lead or challenge
- Provide targeted feedback with specific examples and rewrites
- Use Luca/Greg communication patterns as models

## Key People
- **Luca Prosperi** — CEO, Andrew's manager. Values hard work, sharpness, people who challenge him. Hates yes-men.
- **Gregory Di Prisco** — Co-founder, Chief Architect. Technical leadership.
- **Thor Mathison** — Key operator, handles legal/ops execution

## Baseline Patterns (from initial review)
- Andrew is operationally strong
- Tends to present information without taking positions
- Uses deferential language ("will defer to you guys")
- Operates in support mode rather than driver mode
