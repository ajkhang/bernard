# Self-Funding Project

**Goal:** Make Bernard cash flow neutral or positive (~$200/mo target)

## Cost Breakdown (estimated)
- Claude API (Opus): Primary cost
- Brave Search: Minimal (free tier)
- Other: TBD

## Strategies

### Cost Reduction
- Use Haiku for routine tasks (extraction, simple checks)
- Shorter, denser responses
- Batch operations where possible
- Avoid unnecessary tool calls

### Value Generation
- Time savings for Andrew (quantifiable?)
- Automation replacing paid tools/services
- Research that leads to savings or deals
- Business insights for M0

### Revenue Ideas
- TBD — research needed
- Constraints: Must be ethical, low-effort for Andrew, within my capabilities

## Tracking
- Check in weekly during heartbeats
- Log ideas and progress in items.json
